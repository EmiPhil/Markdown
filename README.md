# A tutorial for markdown.

The whole app is written in vanilla js and may or may not work on browsers other than Chrome which I developed it in.

It is my submission to [Jeff Atwood's competition](http://blog.codinghorror.com/toward-a-better-markdown-tutorial/) and there was not really enough time for full scale testing.

If there is any outside interest in this I would be open to refactoring the spaghetti into a well-tested maintainable app.

Anyways, it *should* run just by clicking index.html. It does for me, anyway.
